This is a simple script to load a directory of RDF files into 
a 4Store endpoint (see http://4store.org/)

In addition to assuming a working 4Store install with a running
SPARQL endpoint, this script depends on the HTTP4Store Python 
module which can be easy installed as follows:

  $ sudo easy_install HTTP4Store
  
For now, files loaded to the endpoint are moved into a sub directory
called "done_rdf".  There is no support for searching a directory
tree recursively (yet).

Installing is simple:

  $ sudo python setup.py install
  
Then usage is:

  $ load24store [OPTIONS...] ENDPOINT GRAPH PATH_TO_RDF
